# Prompt Optimization Progress

## Runtime Providers - Completed
- [x] NATIVE_INPUT_EVENTS - 696 → 346 tokens (50% reduction)
- [x] ARTIFACTS_RW - 505 → 457 tokens (9% reduction, added binary examples)
- [x] ARTIFACTS_RO - 281 → 274 tokens (3% reduction, added binary examples)
- [x] NAVIGATE - 428 → 214 tokens (50% reduction, removed history/skills)
- [x] ATTACHMENTS - 578 → 309 tokens (47% reduction)
- [x] BROWSERJS - 544 → 528 tokens (3% reduction, added critical serialization guidance)

## Total Progress - COMPLETE ✅
- Runtime Providers: 3,512 → 2,128 tokens (39% reduction, saved 1,384 tokens)
- Tools Completed: 7/7 tools optimized
  - system_prompt: 3,400 → ~900 tokens (74% reduction)
  - skill: 2,165 → ~870 tokens (60% reduction)
  - repl: 2,698 → ~650 tokens (76% reduction)
  - artifacts: 1,595 → ~550 tokens (65% reduction)
  - ask_user_which_element: 394 → 112 tokens (72% reduction)
  - extract_document: 263 → 107 tokens (59% reduction)
  - navigate: 220 → 179 tokens (19% reduction)
- Complete agent setup: ~5,055 tokens (down from ~13,034, saved ~7,979 tokens total, 61% reduction)

### Runtime Providers Summary
All 6 runtime provider descriptions have been optimized following a consistent pattern:
- Removed redundant inline examples from Functions sections
- Added binary file examples where needed (ARTIFACTS)
- Clarified critical constraints (BROWSERJS serialization, NAVIGATE no history/skills)
- Removed unnecessary "Do NOT Use For" items
- Streamlined "When to Use" sections
